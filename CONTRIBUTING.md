This guide serves to set clear expectations for everyone involved with the project so that we can improve it together while also creating a welcoming space for everyone to participate. Following these guidelines will help ensure a positive experience for contributors and maintainers.

## :book: Code of Conduct

Please review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/jessesquires/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is in effect at all times. We expect it to be honored by everyone who contributes to this project. Acting like an asshole will not be tolerated.

## :bulb: Asking Questions

See our [Support Guide](https://github.com/jessesquires/.github/blob/master/SUPPORT.md). In short, GitHub issues are not the appropriate place to debug your specific project, but should be reserved for filing bugs and feature requests.

## :inbox_tray: Opening an Issue

Before reporting an issue, check if you are using the latest version of the project. If not, see if updating fixes your issue.

### :lock: Reporting Security Issues

Review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/jessesquires/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md). **Do not** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

### :beetle: Bug Reports and Other Issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. :v:

In short, since you are most likely a developer, **provide a ticket that you would like to receive**.

- **Do not open a duplicate issue!** Look through existing issues to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests. **Prefer using [reactions](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)** if you simply want to "+1" an existing issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable).

## :love_letter: Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We want to avoid [feature creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep). Your idea may be great, but also out-of-scope for the project. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!

- **Do not open a duplicate feature request.** Search for existing requests first. If you find your feature (or one very similar) previously requested, comment on that issue.

- **Fully complete the provided issue template.** The feature request template asks for all necessary information for us to begin a productive conversation. 

- Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.

## :mag: Triaging Issues

You can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for additional information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. Any help you can provide to quickly resolve an issue is very much appreciated!
